# The elements of a vector can optionally be given names. 
# for example, say we have a 50-element vector showing the population of each state in the United States.
# We could name each element according to its state name, such as "Montana" and "New Jersey". 
# This might in turn lead to naming points in plots and so on.
# We can assign or query vector element names via the name() function:

> x <- c(1,2,4)
> names(x)
NULL
> names(x) <- c("a","b","ab")
> names(x)
[1] "a" "b" "ab"
> x
a b ab
1 2 4

# We can remove the names from a vector by assigning NULL:

> names(x) <- NULL
> x
[1] 1 2 4

# We can even reference elements of the vector by name:

> x <- c(1,2,4)
> names(x) <- c("a","b","ab")
> x["b"]
b
2
