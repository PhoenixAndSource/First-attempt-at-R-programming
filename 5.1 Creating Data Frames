# To begin, let's take another look at our simple data frame example from Section 1.4.5:

> kids <- c("Jack","Jill")
> ages <- c(12,10)
> d <- data.frame(kids,ages,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
> d # matrix-like viewpoint
   kids  ages
1  Jack    12
2  Jill    10

# The first two arguments in the call to data.frame() are clear:
# we wish to produce a data frame from our two vectors: kids and ages.
# However, that third argument, stringsAsFactors=FALSE requires more comment.

# If the named argument stringsAsFactors is not specified,
# then by default, stringsAsFactors will be TRUE. (You can also use options() to arrange the opposite default.)
# This means that if we create a data frame from a character vector––in this case, 
# kids––R will convert that vector to a factor.
# Because our work with character data will typically be with vectors rather than factors,
# we'll set stringsAsFactors to FALSE. We'll cover factors in Chapter 6.
