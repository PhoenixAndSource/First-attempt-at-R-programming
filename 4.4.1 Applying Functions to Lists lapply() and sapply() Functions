# Two functions are handy for applying functions to lists: lapply and sapply.

# 4.4.1 Using the lapply() and sapply() Functions
# The function lapply() (for list apply) works like the matrix apply() function,
# calling the specified function on each component of a list (or vector coerced to a list)
# and returning another list. Here's an example:

> lapply(list(1:3,25:29),median)
[[1]]
[1] 2

[[2]]
[1] 27

# R applied median() to 1:3 and to 25:29,
# returning a list consisting of 2 and 27.
# In some cases, such as the example here,
# the list returned by lapply() could be simplified to a vector or matrix.
# This is exactly what sapply() (for simplified [l]apply) does.

> sapply(list(1:3,25:29),median)
[1] 2 27

# You saw an example of matrix output in Section 2.6.2. 
# There, we applied a vectorized, vector-valued function––
# A function whose return value is a vector,
# Each of whose components is vectorized–– to a vector input.
# Using sapply(), rather than applying the function directly,
# gave us the desired matrix form in the output.
