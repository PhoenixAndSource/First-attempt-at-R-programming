# The natural way to refer to rows and columns in a matrix is via the row and column numbers.
# However, you can also give names to these entities.
# Here's an example:

> z
    [,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 3
[2,] 2 4
> colnames(z)
NULL
> colnames(z) <- c("a","b")
> z
     a b
[1,] 1 3
[2,] 2 4
> colnames(z)
[1] "a" "b"
> z[,"a"]
[1] 1 2

# As you see here, these names can then be used to reference specific columns.
# The function rownames() works similarly.

# Naming rows and columns is usually less important when writing R code for general applications, 
# but it can be useful when analyzing a specific data set
