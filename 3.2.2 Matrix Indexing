# The same operations we discussed for vectors in SEction 2.4.2 apply to matrices as well.
# example:

> z
  [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 1    1    1
[2,] 2    1    0
[3,] 3    0    1
[4,] 4    0    0
> z[,2:3]
  [,1] [,2]
[1,] 1    1
[2,] 1    0
[3,] 0    1
[4,] 0    0

# Here, we requested the submatrix of z 
# consisting of all elements with column numbers 2 and 3 and any row number.
# This extracts the second and third columns.
# Here's an example of extracting rows instead of columns:

> y
  [,1] [,2]
[1,]11   12
[2,]21   22
[3,]31   32
> y[2:3,]
  [,1] [,2]
[1,]21   22
[2,]31   32
> y[2:3,2]
[1] 22 32

# You can also assign values to submatrices:

> y
    [,1] [,2]
[1,]   1    4
[2,]   2    5
[3,]   3    6
> y[c(1,3),] <- matrix(c(1,1,8,12),nrow=2)
> y 
    [,1] [,2]
[1,]   1    8
[2,]   2    5
[3,]   1   12

# Here we assigned new values to the first and third rows of y.
# and here's another example of assignment to submatrices:

> x <- matrix(nrow=3,ncol=3)
> y <- matrix(c(4,5,2,3),nrow=2)
> y
    [,1] [,2]
[1,]   4    2
[2,]   5    3
> x[2:3,2:3] <- y
> x
    [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]  NA   NA   NA
[2,]  NA    4    2
[3,]  NA    5    3

# Negative subscripts, used with vectors to exclude certain elements, work the same way with matrices:

> y
    [,1] [,2]
[1,]   1    4
[2,]   2    5
[3,]   3    6
> y[-2,]
    [,1] [,2]
[1,]   1    4
[2,]   3    6

# In the second command, we requested all rows of y except the second.
