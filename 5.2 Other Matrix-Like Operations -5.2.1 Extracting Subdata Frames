# Various matrix operations also apply to data frames. Most notably and usefully,
# we can do filtering to extract various subdata frames of interest.

# 5.2.1 Extracting Subdata Frames
# As mentioned, a data frame can be viewed in row-and-column terms.
# In particular, we can extract subdata frames by rows or columns.
# Here's an example:

> examsquiz[2:5,]
  Exam.1  Exam.2  Quiz
2    3.3       2   3.7
3    4.0       4   4.0
4    2.3       0   3.3
5    2.3       1   3.3
> examsquiz[2:5,2]
[1] 2 4 0 1
> class(examsquiz[2:5,2])
[1] "numeric"
> examsquiz[2:5,2,drop=FALSE])
[1] "data.frame"

# Note that in that second call, since examsquiz[2:5,2] is a vector, 
# R created a vector instead of another data frame.
# By specifying drop=FALSE,
# as described for the matrix case in Section 3.6, we can keep it as a 
# (one-column) data frame.
# We can also do filtering. Here's how to extract the subframe of all students 
# whose first exam score was at least 3.8

> examsquiz[examsquiz$Exam.1 >= 3.8,]
    Exam.1  Exam.2  Quiz
3        4     4.0   4.0
9        4     3.3   4.0
11       4     4.0   4.0
14       4     0.0   4.0
16       4     3.7   4.0
19       4     4.0   4.0
22       4     4.0   4.0
25       4     4.0   3.3
29       4     3.0   3.7
