#an example of a compound command: (I think that means that there is more than one element within the paranthesis?)
nrow(subset(x03,z == 1))

#subset() function takes data frame x03 and grabs all the info stored in variable "z is 1"
# R is polymorphic => 1 function can be assigned to different types of inputs, which then, the function processes it in the appropriate way. => "generic function"
