# an example of a compound command: (I think that means that there is more than one element within the paranthesis?)
nrow(subset(x03,z == 1))

# Object-Oriented Programming:

# Statistical regression, regression analysis with SAS or SPSS -> ton of output.
# But if you call lm() regression function in R, the function returns an object containing all the results.

# subset() function takes data frame x03 and grabs all the info stored in variable "z is 1"
# R is polymorphic => 1 function can be assigned to different types of inputs, which then, 
# the function processes it in the appropriate way. => "generic function" (C++ calls a similar concept "virtual function")
