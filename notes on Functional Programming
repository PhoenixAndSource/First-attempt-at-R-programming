# Functional Programming notes

# R programming typically does not use explicit iteration (repeated sequence of operations)
# - instead of coding loops, use R's functional features - helps you make iterative behaviors implicit 
# - in other words, operations are automatically applied to each item in a data structure 
# without explicitly specifying the iteration process. 
# Which makes code more efficient, especially when R runs large data sets.

# Advantages of the functional programming nature of the R language:
# Clear, compact code
# fast execution
# code is simple - less bugs
# easy transition for parallel programming
