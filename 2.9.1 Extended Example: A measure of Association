# In assessing the statistical relation of two variables,
# there are many alternatives to the standard correlation measure
# (Pearson product-moment correlation).
# Some readers may have heard of the Spearman rank correlation, for example.
# These alternative measures have various motivations,
# such as robustness to outliers
# which are extreme and possibly erroneous data items.

# Let's propose a new such measure, not necessarily for novel statistical merits
# (actually it is related to one in broad use, Kendall's τ or tau.)
# but to illustrate some of the R programming techniques introduced in this chapter,
# especially ifelse().

# consider vectors x and y, which are time series,
# for example for measurements of air temperature and pressure collected once each house.

# we'll defend our measure of association between them 
# to be the fraction of the time x and y increase or decrease together—
# that is in proportion of I for which y[ i + 1 ] - y[ i ] has the same sign as x[ i + 1] - x[ I ]
# here is the code:

# fundud() converts vector v to 1s, 0s, representing an element
# increasing or not, relative to the previous one;
# output length is 1
# less than input
findud <- function(v) {
 
}
