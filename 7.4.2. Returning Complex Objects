# Since the return value can be any R object, you can return complex objects.
# Here is an example of a function being returned:

> g
function() {
  t <- function(x) return(x^2)
  return(t)
}

> g()
function(x) return(x^2)
<environment: 0x8aafbc0>

# If your function has multiple return values, place them in a list or other container.
