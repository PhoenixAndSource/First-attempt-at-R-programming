# Recall our course examination data set in Section 1.5
# There, we didn't have a header, but for this example we do, 
# And the first few records in the file now are as follows:

"Exam 1"  "Exam 2"  Quiz
2.01      3.3       4.0
3.3       2.0       3.7
4.0       4.0       4.0
2.3       0.0       3.3
2.3       1.0       3.3
3.3       3.7       4.0

# As you can see, each line contains the three test scores for one student.
# this is the classic two-dimensional file notion, like that alluded to in the preceding output of str().
# Here, each line in our file contains the data for one observation in a statistical data set.
# The idea of a data fram is to encapsulate such data, along with variable names, into one object.

# Notice that we have separated the fields here by spaces.
# Other delimiters maybe specified, notably commas for comma-separated value (CSV) files
# (As you'll see in Section 5.2.5).
# The variable names specified in the first record must be separated by the same delimiter as used for the data,
# which is spaces in this case.
# If the names themselves contain embedded spaces, as we have there, they must be quoted.
# We read in the file as before, but in this case we state that there is a header record:

examsquiz <- read.table("exams",header=TRUE)

# The column names now appear, with periods replacing blanks:

> head(examsquiz)
