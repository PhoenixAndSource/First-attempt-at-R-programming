# Without arguments, a call to ls() from within a function 
# returns the names of the current local variables (including arguments).
# With the envir argument, it will print the names 
# of the locals of any frame in the call chain.
# Here's an example:

> f
function(y) {
  d <- 8
  return(h(d,y))
}
> h
function(dee,yyy) {
  print(ls())
  print(ls(envir=parent.frame(n=1)))
  return(dee*(w+yyy))
}

> f(2)
[1] "dee" "yyy"
[1] "d" "y"
[1] 112

# With parent.frame(), the argument n specifies how many frames to go up in the call chain.
# Here, we were in the midst of executing h(), which had been called from f(),
# so specifying n = 1 gives us f()'s frame, and thus we get its locals.
