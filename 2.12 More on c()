# In this section, we'll discuss a couple of miscellaneous facts related to the concatenate function, c()
# if the arguments you pass to c() are of differing modes, 
# they will be reduced to a type that is the lowest common denominator as follows:

> c(5,2,"abc")
[1] "5" "2" "abc"
> c(5,2,list(a=1,b=4))
[[1]]
[1] 5

[[2]]
[1] 2
$a
[1] 1

$b
[1] 4

# In the first example, we are mixing integer and character modes, 
# a combination that R chooses to reduce to the latter mode.
# In the second example, R considers the list mode to be of lower precedence in the mixed expressions
# which we''ll discuss further in Section 4.3.
# You might not wish to write code that makes such combinations, but you may encounter code in which this occurs,
# so it's important to understand the effect,
# another point to keep in mind is that c() has a flattening effect for vectors, as in this example:

> c(5,2,c(1.5,6))
[1] 5.0 2.0 1.5 6.0
