# In this section, we'll discuss a couple of miscellaneous facts related to the concatenate function, c()
# if the arguments you pass to c() are of differing modes, 
# they will be reduced to a type that is the lowest common denominator as follows:

> c(5,2,"abc")
[1] "5" "2" "abc"
> c(5,2,list(a=1,b=4))
[[1]]
[1] 5

[[2]]
[1] 2
$a
[1] 1

$b
[1] 4
