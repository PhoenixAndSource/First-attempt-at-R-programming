On an intuitive level, a data frame is like a matrix,
with a two-dimensional rows-and-columns structure.
However, it differs from a matrix in that each column may have a different mode.
For instance, one column may consist of numbers,
and another column might have character strings.
In this sense, just as lists are the heterogeneous analogs of vectors in one dimension,
data frames are the heterogeneous analogs of matrices for two-dimensional data.

On a technical level, a data frame is a list, with the components of 
that list being equal-length vectors. Actually, R does allow the components
to be other types of objects, including other data frames. This give us 
heterogeneous-data analog of arrays in our analogy.
But this use of data frames is rare in practice, here, we will assume all components
of a data frame are vectors.

In this chapter, we'll present quite a few data frame examples, so you
can become familiar with their variety of uses in R.
