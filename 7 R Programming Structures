# R is a block-structured language in the manner of the ALGOL-descendent family,
# such as C, C++, Python, Perl, and so on.
# As you've seen, blocks are delineated by braces, 
# though braces are optional if the block consists of just a single statement.
# Statements are separated by newline characters or, optionally, by semicolons.

# Here, we cover the basic structures of R as a programming language.
# We'll review some more details on loops and the like 
# and then head straight into the topic of functions
# In particular, issues of variable scope will play a major role.
# As with many scripting languages, you do not "declare" variables in R.
# Programmers who have a background in, say the C language, 
# will find similarities in R at first but then will see that R has a richer scoping structure.
