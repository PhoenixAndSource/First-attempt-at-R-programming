# the seq() function generates various kinds of numeric sequences in arithmetic progression
# running example(seq) resulted in R's running some examples of seq().
# useful for graphics. You can use the example() function to give you a "graphic" illustration.
# example:

> example(persp)

# This displays a series of sample graphs for the persp() function.
# Press enter in the R console when you are ready to see the next one.
# the code for each example is shown in the console, so you can experiment by tweaking the arguments.

# 1.7.3 If you don't know quite what you're looking for.
# Use the function help.search() to do a google-style search through R's documentation.
# For example you want to find a function to generate random variates from multivariate normal distributions.
# To determine which function, if any, does this, you could try
> help.search("multivariate normal")
# this produces a response containing this excerpt:
mvrnorm(MASS)   Simulate from a Multivariate Normal
                Distribution
# You can see that the function mvrnorm() will do the job, and it is in the package MASS.
# There is also a question-mark shortcut to help.search():
> ??"multivariate normal"

# 1.7.4 Help for Other Topics
# R's help files have pages for specific functions
# help for function mvrnorm() which is in the package MASS
> ?mvrnorm

# you can learn about the entire package like this:
> help(package=MASS)

# help is available for general topics.
# to learn about files:
> ?files
# this gives you information about a number of file-manipulation functions, such as file.create().
# some other topics:
Arithmetic
Comparison
Control
Dates
Extract
Math
Memory
NA
NULL
NumericaConstants
Paren
Quotes
Startup
Syntax

# 1.7.5 Help for Batch Mode
# R has batch commands that allow you to run a command directly from your operating system's shell.
# get help on a particular batch command, you can type:
R CMD command --help
For example, to learn all the options associated with the INSTALL command you can type
R CMD INSTALL --help

# 1.7.6 Help on the Internet 
# R project's manuals http://www.r-project.org/. click manuals.
# Various R search engines listed on R home page. Click Search.
# The sos package offers highly sophisticated searching of R materials
# RSeek search engine: http://www.rseek.org/
# post your R questions to r-help, the R list server: http://www.r-project.org/mail.html
# Gmane (http://www.gmane.org/)
# R is difficult to search for using general purpose search engines such as Google
# use Google's filetype criterion. to search for R scripts files having a .R suffix 
# search files having .R suffix related to permutations, enter:
filetype:R permutations -rebol
# the -rebol asks Google to exclude pages with the word "rebol" 
# because the REBOL programming language uses the same suffix (.R)
# The comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://cran.r-project.org/ 
# is a repository of user-contributed R code so it is a good Google search term.
# for example, search "lm CRAN" helps you find material on R's lm() function.
