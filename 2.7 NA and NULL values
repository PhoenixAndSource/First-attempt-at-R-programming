# those with a background in other scripting languages may be aware of "no such animal" values,
# such as None in Python and undefined in Perl.
# R actually has two such values: NA and NULL.
# In statistical data sets, we often encounter missing data, 
# which we represent in R with the value NA.
# NULL, on the other hand, represents that the value in question simply does not exist.
# (rather than being existent but unknown)

# 2.7.1 Using NA
# In many of R's statistical functions, 
# we can instruct the function to skip over any missing values, or NAs
# example:

> x <- c(88,NA,12,168,13)
> x
[1] 88 NA 12 168 13
> mean(x)
[1] NA
> mean(x,na.rm=T)
[1] 70.25
> x <- c(88,NULL,12,168,13)
> mean(x)
[1] 70.25

# In the first call, mean() refused to calculate, as one value in x was NA.
# But by setting the optional argument na.rm (NA remove) to true (T),
# we calculated the mean of the remaining elements.
# But R automatically skipped over the NULL value, which we'll look at in the next section.
# There are multiple NA values, one for each mode:

> x <- c(5,NA,12)
> mode(x[1])
[1] "numeric"
> mode(x[2])
[1] "numeric"
> y <- c("abc","def",NA)
> mode(y[2])
[1] "character"
> mode(y[3])
[1] "character"
