# Now that we've covered the basics of creating a matrix, we'll look at some common operations performed with matrices.
# These include performing linear algebra operations, matrix indexing and matrix filtering.

# 3.2.1 Performing Linear Algebra Operations on Matrices
# You can perform various linear algebra operations on matrices, 
# such as a matrix multiplication, matrix scalar multiplication, and matrix addition.
# using y from the preceding example, here is how to perform those three operations:

> y %*% y # mathematical matrix multiplication
  [,1] [,2]
[1,] 7   15
[2,] 10  22
> 3*y # mathematical multiplication of matrix by scalar
  [,1] [,2]
[1,] 3    9
[2,] 6   12
>  y+y # mathematical matrix addition
  [,1] [,2]
[1,] 2    6
[2,] 4    8

# For more on linear algebra operations on matrices, see Section 8.4.
