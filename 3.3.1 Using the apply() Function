# One of the most famous and most used features of R is the *apply() family of functions, such as apply(), lapply(). 
# Here, we'll look at apply(), which instructs R
# to call a user-specified function on each of the rows or each of the columns of a matrix.

# This is the general form of apply for matrices:

apply(m,dimcode,f,fargs)
