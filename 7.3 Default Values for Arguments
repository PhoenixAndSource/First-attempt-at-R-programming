In section 5.1.2, we read in a data set from a file named exams:

> testscores <- read.table("exams",header=TRUE)

# The argument header=TRUE tells R that we have a header line,
# so R should not count that first line in the file as data.
# This is an example of the use of named arguments.
# Here are the first few lines of the function:

> read.table
function (file, header = FALSE, sep = "", quote = "\"'", dec = ",",
    row.names, col.names, as.is = !stringsAsFactors, na.strings = "NA",
    colClasses = NA, nrows = -1, skip = 0, check.names = TRUE,
    fill = !blank.lines.skip, strip.white = FALSE, flush = FALSE,
    stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors(), encoding = "unknown")
{
    if (is.character(file)) {
        file <- file(file, "r")
        on.exit(close(file))
...
...

# The second formal argument is named header.
# The = FALSE field means that this argument is optional, 
# and if we don't specify it, the default value will be FALSE.
# If we don't want the default value, we must name the argument in our call:

> testscores <- read.table("exams",header=TRUE)

# Hence the terminology named argument.
# Note, though, that because R uses lazy evaluation––it does not evaluate and expression until/unless it needs to––
# The named argument may not actually be used.
