# 1.3 Intro to Functions

# R programming consists of writing functions
# A function is:
# - a group of instructions that takes inputs
# - uses them to compute other values 
# - returns a result

# example function named oddcount() 
# - purpose is to count the odd numbers in a vector of integers.
# - normally we  compose the function code using a text editor and save it in a file,
# - but in this example, we enter it line by line in R's interactive mode.
# - then we'll call the function on a couple of test cases.

# counts the number of odd integers in x
> offcount <- function(x) {
+    k <- 0 # assign 0 to k
+    for (n in x) {
+       if (n %% 2 == 1) k <- k+1 # %% is the modulo operator
+    }
+    return(k)
+ }
> oddcount(c(1,3,5))
[1] 3
> oddcount(c(1,2,3,7,9))
[1] 4

# First we told R that we wanted to define a function named oddcount with one argument, x.
# the left brace demarcates the start of the body of the function.
# We wrote one R statement per line.
# Until the body of the function is finished, 
# - R reminds you that you're still in the definition by using + as its prompt, instead of the usual >.
# + is a line-continuation character, not a prompt for a new input.
# R resumes the > prompt after you finally enter a right brace to conclude the function body.

# after defining the function, we evaluated two calls to oddcount(). 
# Since there are three odd numbers in the vector (1,3,5), the call oddcount(c(1,3,5)) returns the value 3.
# There are four odd numbers in (1,2,3,7,9), so the second call returns 4.
# the modulo operator for remainder arithmetic is %% in R which is noted in the comment.
# For example, 38 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 3:

> 38 %% 7
[1] 3

# another example:

for (n in x) {
  if (n %% 2 == 1) k <- k+1
}

# First it set n to x[1] then tests that value for being odd or even.
# If the value is odd, in this case, the count variable k is incremented.
# n is set to x[2] tested for being odd or even and so on.
